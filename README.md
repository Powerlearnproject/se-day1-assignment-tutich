Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
a. Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods and tools to the development and maintenance of high quality software systems.It involves design, development, testing and maintenance of software products.
b. Software engineering plays a crucial role in technology industry by enabling creation of software applcations that power various aspects of modern life including commerce, healthcare, education and entertainment.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. Development of programming languages - The development of programming languages progressed from early machine code to increasingly higher-level languages, with key milestones 
   including Fortran introducing higher-level abstraction for scientific computing, C becoming a foundational language for systems programming .
2. Establishment of software engineering as discpline - The conference in 1960s brought together international experts who agreed to apply the systematic approach of physical world 
   engineering to software development.
3. Advent of structurred programming in 1970s - a programming technique that organizes programs into a hierarchy of modules. This improves readability and maintainability.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
a. Requirements - Gathering and outlining user needs and requirements.
b. Design - Creating high level and detailed designs of the architecture of desired software.
c. Implementation - Writing the code according to the design.
d. Testing - Thorough testing of the software to ensure it meets the standards for quality assurance.
e. Deployment - Hosting the software and releasing to users.
f. Maintenance - Providing ongoing support and updates.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall refers to sequential approach with distinct phases i.e requirements, design and implementation , flowing downwards like a waterfall while agile methodologies is an iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration and rresponding to change,i.e, regular cycles where teams reflect and improve after each sprint. 

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer - Responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
Quality Assurance Engineer - Ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
Project Manager - Oversees planning, execution and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
a. Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) provides comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code ,e.g., Visual Studio.
b. Version Control Systems (VCS) helps in tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members ,e.g, Git. 

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Challenges:
a. Changing requirements.
   Tight deadlines.
   Technical debts.

 Strategies to overcome:
 b. Effective communication.
    Agile methodologies.
    Prioritization of tasks.
   
Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing - Testing individual components or modules of a software.
Integration testing - Testing interactions between different components or modules in a software.
Sytem testing - Testing entire software system as a whole.
Acceptance testing - Testing the software against the user requirements to ensure it meets the standards and user needs.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
a. Prompt engineering refers to crafting questions or statements to get the best possible response from AI models.
b. Prompt engineering helps avoid confusing answers by making your questions clear, specific, and concise, so that the AI understands exactly what you need.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
vague prompt - Tell me about space.
Clear prompt - Tell me about planets and the solar system.

The improved prompt is more effective since its clear, specific , and concise hence its more focused.
